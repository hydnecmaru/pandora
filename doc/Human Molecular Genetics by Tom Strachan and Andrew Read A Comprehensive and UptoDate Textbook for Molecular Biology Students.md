The book aims to provide an authoritative and integrated approach to the subject, combining basic principles of nucleic acid structure and gene expression with applications to human diseases and evolution. The book is divided into five parts: Basics of DNA, chromosomes, cells, development and inheritance; Understanding Genomes; Genetic Variation Between Individuals and Species; Genetics of Disease; and Human Molecular Genetics in Practice. Each part consists of several chapters that cover topics such as DNA technologies, gene regulation, genetic manipulation, genome architecture, population genetics, cancer genetics, genetic testing and gene therapy. The book also includes a new chapter on human evolution and anthropology from the authors of the highly acclaimed Human Evolutionary Genetics.
  
The book is designed for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students who are studying human molecular genetics or genomics courses. It is also suitable for researchers and professionals who need a reference book on the field. The book is supported by superb artwork that illustrates the key concepts and mechanisms, as well as summary boxes, annotated further reading and online resources. The book is praised by reviewers for its clarity, accuracy, breadth and depth of coverage, and pedagogical features.
  
Human Molecular Genetics is available as a hardcover or an ebook from various online platforms. A pdf version of the book can be accessed from some websites that offer free downloads of academic books[^1^] [^2^]. However, these websites may not be legal or safe to use, and may violate the authors' copyrights. Therefore, it is recommended to purchase the book from official sources or borrow it from a library.
  
One of the strengths of Human Molecular Genetics is its integration of different aspects of molecular biology and genetics. The book shows how the molecular mechanisms of DNA, RNA and proteins underlie the inheritance and variation of human traits and diseases. It also demonstrates how the advances in genomic technologies have enabled the discovery of new genes and pathways involved in human health and evolution. The book provides examples and case studies that illustrate the applications and implications of molecular genetics in medicine, biotechnology and anthropology.
  
Another strength of Human Molecular Genetics is its accessibility and readability. The book explains complex concepts and terms in a clear and concise manner, using diagrams, tables and figures to aid understanding. The book also avoids unnecessary jargon and technical details that may confuse or overwhelm the readers. The book assumes some prior knowledge of basic biology and chemistry, but provides sufficient background information and revision material for those who need it. The book also offers online resources such as animations, videos, quizzes and exercises that complement the text and enhance learning.
  
A final strength of Human Molecular Genetics is its currency and relevance. The book reflects the latest developments and discoveries in the field of molecular genetics, such as the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system, single-cell genomics, epigenomics, microbiome analysis and ancient DNA analysis. The book also discusses the ethical, social and legal issues that arise from the applications of molecular genetics in human affairs, such as genetic testing, gene therapy, personalized medicine and ancestry testing. The book provides a balanced and critical perspective on these topics, highlighting both the benefits and challenges of molecular genetics for humanity.
