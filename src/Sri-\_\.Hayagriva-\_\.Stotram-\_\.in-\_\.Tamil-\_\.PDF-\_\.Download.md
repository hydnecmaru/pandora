I meditate on Lord Hayagriva, who is the embodiment of supreme bliss and pure consciousness,
 Who has a radiant white complexion and a horse's face,
 Who is the foundation of all branches of knowledge.
 
The stotram then describes the various aspects of Lord Hayagriva's form and attributes, such as his lotus navel, his gem chest, his four arms, his weapons, his smile, his voice, his crown, his book, and his japa mala.
